// Homework 3: countDigits

/*
*If a number has one digit, it should be less than 10 
*If a number has two digits, it should be less than 100 and greater than 9.
*If a number has three digits, it should be greater than 99 and less than 1000.
*Using this patterns I put in if statements
*If theres one digit, output 1, if theres two 2 digits output 2...
