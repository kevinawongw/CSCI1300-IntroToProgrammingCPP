//Pseudocode
/*
main (already written) directs the computer to run the void game function (which returns nothing).
void game first tells the computer to run intro.
run into outputs a welcome statememt welcoming the user to Jeopardy dice.
then define functions playerTotal and computerTotal as a global variable.
then define finalTotal (which is the player's total after each round) and finalComputerTotal (which is the computer's total after each round) equal to zero.
void game then tells the computer to run the function "playerTotal"
playerTotal runs on a while loop which states that a loop will occur as long as both finalTotal and finalComputerTotal is less than one hundred.
the loop takes the computer to the function "turnTotal"
turnTotal is a function that gets the players score per turn, then at the end of the function, it will find the player's total score for that round and add it to the finalTotal (which is the player's final score at the end of the round)
turnTotalbegins by setting roll and total to zero. Then, there is an outout statement asking the user whether or not they want to roll a dice. If the user inputs yes, then it will enter a while loop which will not break until the user says no. 
In the turnTotal while loop, it tells the computer to generate a new random number, and the followig happens:
if the random number (called "roll") is a 3, the turnTotal will be 15 and the loop will break. It will add 15 to the finalTotal
if the random number (called "roll") is a 2,4, or 5, the turn will be the rolled number added to the previous score. Then it will ask if the user wants to roll again.
if the random number (called "roll") is anything else (meaning a 1 or 6), then the turn total becomes 0 and the loop breaks.
in turnTotal, no matter what number is rolled, it will output a statement saying what the number rolled and what the turnTotal is.
since this function ends goes back to playerTotal and then there is an output statement that states the player's finalTotal and the finalComputerTotal.
then the function playerTotal tells the computer to go to function "computerTotal"
computerTotal starts with an output statement saying that it's the computer's turn.
then it enters a while loop which will run as long as the computer's turn total is less than 10.
within the while loop, a random number will be rolled, and there are if statements that are the same as the if statements in turnTotal (lines 22-24).
the while loop will break if the computer rolls a 1,3, or 6. 
at the end of the function, whatever the computer scored tha round is added to finalComputerTotal
then the function ends and goes back to playerTotal which outputs an output statement saying each of the final scores.
playerTotal loops until either the player or computer reaches 100. When this happens, the loop will break and it will output a statement saying congratulations __ won the game.
